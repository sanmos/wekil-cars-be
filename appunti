git remote add origin https://github.com/sanmos/wekil-cars-be.git

I was getting the same error

ERROR: Repository not found.   
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
and I had created the repository on Github and cloned it locally.

I was able to solve by opening .git/config and removing the [remote "origin"] section.

[remote "origin"]   
   url = git@github.com:alexagui/my_project.git  
   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
then I ran the following (again)

git remote add origin git@github.com:alexagui/my_project.git  
git push -u origin master
and this time I was able to push to the repository.
